# Particle Algorithms for SSMs

Each run of a model is in a seperate Jupyter Notebook file.
There are Markdown chapters that indicate each part of the code.
The "Load Dataset" chapter contains paths to loading the dataset,
that should be modified appropriately.

The SDS model used is modified from https://github.com/charlio23/identifiable-SDS/tree/main

We also modified the VRNN,IWAE,FIVO functions from https://github.com/charlio23/identifiable-SDS/tree/main
